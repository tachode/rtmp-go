# RTMP Specifications

The base RTMP stream format is described in four main documents:

* [The 2012 RTMP specification](rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf)
* [Adobe's specification of the AMF0 format](amf0_spec_121207.pdf)
* [Adobe's specification of the AMF3 format](amf3_spec_05_05_08.pdf) -- Not currently implemented in this project
* [Adobe Flash Video File Format Specification](http://download.macromedia.com/f4v/video_file_format_spec_v10_1.pdf)

These first three documents are hosted locally by this repository because there are no stable, official locations that reliably make them available.

Additionally, the status codes used by RTMP are documented as part of [Adobe's documentation of the NetStream class](https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-media-server/ssaslr/netstream-class.html)
